# Rubagotchi

**This is a completed example of the Rubagotchi tamagotchi game.**

What we are going to achieve here today is nothing short of a miracle. For we, dear friends, shall create life, LIFE!

Or, well, not life but a nifty approximation of it in the form of a tamagotchi built in Ruby.

Why Ruby?
---------
Ruby is an extremely approachable programming language, especially for beginners. It puts emphasis on readability, versitility and ease of use. 

In other words, learning to code in Ruby lets you focus on what you're doing and why rather than worrying if a ```}``` should be followed by a ```;```.

Ultimately it doesn't matter too much which coding language you start in, the core concepts of good software engineering are consistent in just about any language, the most important thing is to dive in, start playing, building and having some fun along the way.

Setup
-----
**Text Editor:**

Writing code is just that, writing, it's something anyone who has used a computer will be used to. But whilst apps like Microsoft Word can offer many wonderous ways to ruin a document by moving an image slightly to the left, they are not what you want for coding.

There are however a myriad of fantastic text editors designed with coding in mind, any of which will be perfect for this project.

I'd suggest getting started with [Atom](https://atom.io/), as it's free. friendly and fantastic. Also, with the syntax highlighting, all you will need is an artisanal coffee and beanie hat to complete the "professional software engineer look"&trade;.

**Installing Ruby:**

Mac:

* Open up your terminal, you can find it in Applications/Utilities.
* Install Homebrew by typing this command in the terminal.
  ```
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```
* Install ruby
  ```
  brew install ruby
  ```

Windows:

* [Download and install Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/)
* Open command prompt, you can find it in the start menu under All Programs -> Accessories.

Linux:

* Open up your terminal On Ubuntu, go to Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal or you can use Ctrl+Alt+T
* Check if Ruby is installed by entering this command in the terminal
  ```
  which ruby
  ```
* If which ruby returns a path such as "/usr/bin/ruby" You are good to go.
* Otherwise enter (Note: you will likely need your password)
  ```
  sudo apt-get install ruby-full
  ```

Get started
-----------

* Clone or download this repository
* Navigate to `rubagotchi` using the terminal, and run the program
```
cd rubagotchi
ruby play.rb
```
